# Conclusions

Artificial Intelligence is relevant and ubiquitous. Speech controlled personal assistants, face recognition in cameras, learning spam filters in e-mail clients and AI in computer games are examples of AI applications in everyday use.

After all, AI applications are IT applications and software engineering skills are required for their development. "Applied Artificial Intelligence -- An Engineering Approach" focuses on exactly those skills. 

Many AI applications have implications on our society. Increasing automation in manufacturing and agricultural industries has a strong impact on the workforce. The use of autonomous vehicles will raise new legal issues when severe accidents will occur. Most critically, the advent of lethal autonomous weapons systems raise most severe ethical issues. See for example an [open letter](http://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/) signed by more than 1,000 AI professionals to "ban an offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control".
So, developers of AI applications have to consider impacts of those applications on our society and act responsibly.
