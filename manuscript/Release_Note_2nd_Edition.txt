Dear readers,

It it 5 years ago that I published the first edition of "Applied Artificial Intelligence - An Engineering Approach". In the meantime, AI has gained enormous attention - a new hype. The development of new AI technologies is rapid. So, it is time for the second edition. 
Here is what I have added:

- Impacts of AI on society
- Guidelines for selecting ML approaches
- Bias in ML
- Learning curve analysis
- Use of pre-trained models in deep learning
- Using Wikidata 
- Rule-based reasoning
- NLP with bag-of-words model, tf-idf and n-grams
- Computer vision with convolutional neural networks and transfer learning
- Complex event processing
- Updated AI product maps

Get the current version and have fun reading "Applied Artificial Intelligence - An Engineering Approach", Second Edition. I look forward to your comments.

Best regards
